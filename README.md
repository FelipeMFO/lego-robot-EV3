# Lego EV3 Robot

Ã‰cole des Mines final project - LEJOS EV3 follower robot, source code. In order to execute it you'll need a EV3 Lego robot with an embeded Lejos system on it, as well as its sensors and motors.

The objective of this project was to create an automated robot based on a system machine. Each state transition would be triggered by a sensor detection or an motor action. With only those transitions and each state being configurated to run the motors in a specific way, it was possible to fully edit the robot functions over its 'state machine backbone'.
